# What do you call this in JavaScript?

This is a list of ambiguous symbols used in JavaScript that may be confusing to search for on the web.

## The list

| Symbol | Description    | Colloquial verbiage |
| ------ | -------------- | ------------------- |
| `=>`   | Arrow function | _"Hash rocket", "fat arrow"_ |
| `===`   | Strict equality | _"Equal"_ |
| `==`   | Loose equality | No one calls it anything. Don't use this. |
| `!!`   | Convert to boolean | "bang bang, you're boolean", "not not", "bang bang" |
